## Project Overview

### 1. Simple Calculator
I created a simple calculator using the Atmega 32 microcontroller (AVR), capable of performing basic arithmetic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

Highlights:
- Microcontroller: Atmega 32 (AVR)
- Display: 2x16 LCD
- Input: 4x4 Keypad
- Development Environment: Eclipse

### 2. Weather Station System
This project involved designing a weather station that monitors temperature using a dedicated sensor.

Highlights:
- Microcontroller: Atmega 32 (AVR)
- Temperature Sensor: LM35
- Fan Control: DC Fan
- Display: 2x16 LCD
- Development Environment: Eclipse

Functionality:
1. Fan off if temperature < 20°C.
2. 50% duty cycle (20°C - 22°C).
3. 75% duty cycle (22°C - 25°C).
4. 90% duty cycle (25°C - 30°C).
5. 100% duty cycle if temperature > 30°C.

### 3. Smart Home System
I developed a Smart Home System using a master-slave configuration with two Atmega 32 microcontrollers.

Highlights:
- Microcontrollers: 2 Atmega 32 (AVR)
- Display: 2x16 LCD
- Input: 4x4 Keypad
- Components: 3.3mm LEDs and various switches
- Development Environment: Eclipse

### 4. Traffic Light System (RTOS)
This project features a traffic light system built with a real-time operating system (RTOS).

Highlights:
- Microcontroller: Atmega 32 (AVR)
- LEDs: 3x3.3mm
- Development Environment: Eclipse

Functionality:
- Red LED: 60 seconds 
- Yellow LED (waiting): 5 seconds 
- Green LED: 30 seconds 
- Cycle back to Yellow for 5 seconds before returning to Red.

### 5. Traffic Light System (FreeRTOS)
I designed this traffic light system using FreeRTOS for traffic control simulation.

Highlights:
- Microcontroller: Atmega 32 (AVR)
- **LEDs: 3x3.3mm
- Development Environment: Eclipse

Functionality:
- Follows the same timing rules as the RTOS-based project.
